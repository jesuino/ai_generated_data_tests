This document provides a markdown-friendly summary of the Wikipedia page titled 'List of countries by GDP (nominal)'.

## Overview
The page focuses on listing countries based on their nominal GDP, which is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a year without adjustments for cost-of-living differences. The data presented comes from three major sources: the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the United Nations Statistics Division.

## Key Points
- **GDP Definition**: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the economic output of a nation annually.
- - **Nominal vs PPP**: Nominal GDP does not account for purchasing power parity, leading to variations influenced by exchange rate fluctuations.
  - - **Ranking Changes**: Rankings can shift due to currency value changes rather than actual economic performance.
    - - **Historical Context**: The U.S. surpassed the British Empire's GDP around 1916, while China's rapid growth since transitioning to a market economy in 1978 has elevated it significantly.
